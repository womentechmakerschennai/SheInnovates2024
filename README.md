- **problem category** : women specific problem

## problem Statement :
- In India, women's safety remains a pressing concern, particularly during their daily commutes.
- Despite efforts to address this issue, the relief and prevention measures fall short of adequately safeguarding women.
- The reported cases merely scratch the surface of the myriad challenges women encounter, ranging from verbal harassment to physical assaults, while navigating public spaces.
- The lack of comprehensive and effective strategies exacerbates the sense of vulnerability experienced by women, hindering their ability to move freely and confidently in society.

## proposed solution :
Our team MClub introduces an application called **BubbleWomen**
- This innovative application serves as a powerful tool for empowering women to navigate their surroundings safely.
- By leveraging location data, it identifies potentially risky areas along their routes, enhancing their awareness and enabling them to make informed decisions about their safety.
- Furthermore, the app assists in locating nearby groups of people, providing a sense of security and acting as a deterrent to potential threats.
- Its functionality extends to facilitating immediate assistance by allowing users to connect and call other app users when crossing these identified hotspots, fostering a community of support and solidarity among women.
In essence, this application not only equips women with essential safety tools but also fosters a sense of empowerment and solidarity in navigating public spaces.

## Innovative factors :
- **Real-Time Risk Identification:** Utilizes real-time location data to identify and alert users about potential risk zones along their routes, offering dynamic and personalized safety information.

- **Women to Women (W to W) Platform:** Introduces a unique community feature that allows users to connect with nearby groups, fostering mutual support and creating a collective deterrent against potential threats.

- **Safety Zone Indication:** Incorporates a visual representation of secure areas, empowering users to make informed and safer choices as they navigate through different locations.

- **Social Media-Like Platform:** Provides a dedicated space within the app for users to share their safety experiences, creating a supportive community and leveraging collective wisdom to enhance overall safety awareness.

- **Proactive Decision-Making:** Enables users to adopt a proactive approach to personal security by providing real-time information about potential risk areas, allowing them to plan and adjust their routes accordingly.
